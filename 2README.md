# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): Waterfall vs Agile Model

![Sample Image](img/waterfall.png)


# Waterfall Methodology

## Overview
The **Waterfall Model** is a sequential software development methodology where progress flows in one direction—like a waterfall—through defined phases. Each phase must be completed before moving to the next, ensuring a structured approach to software development.

---

## Phases of the Waterfall Model

### 1️⃣ Requirements Gathering & Analysis
- Understand and document user requirements.
- Outputs: Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document.

### 2️⃣ System Design
- Define the overall system architecture.
- Outputs: High-Level Design (HLD), Low-Level Design (LLD).

### 3️⃣ Implementation (Coding)
- Convert design documents into actual code.
- Outputs: Developed software modules.

### 4️⃣ Testing
- Identify and fix bugs.
- Outputs: Test Cases, Test Reports.

### 5️⃣ Deployment
- Deploy the software in the live environment.
- Outputs: Release notes, Deployment reports.

### 6️⃣ Maintenance
- Fix issues and provide updates.
- Outputs: Bug fixes, Feature updates.

```

## Advantages ✅
- Simple and easy to understand.
- Clear documentation and well-defined phases.
- Best for projects with clear, stable requirements.

## Disadvantages ❌
- Rigid, does not accommodate changes easily.
- Late testing phase may lead to expensive bug fixes.
- Not suitable for complex, evolving projects.

---

## When to Use Waterfall Model?
- When project requirements are **well-defined**.
- When changes are **unlikely** during development.
- For **small to medium-sized** projects.

---

## Comparison with Agile 📊
| Feature         | Waterfall Model | Agile Model |
|---------------|---------------|------------|
| Flexibility    | Rigid         | Highly flexible |
| Feedback       | Late-stage    | Continuous |
| Testing        | After development | Throughout |
| Project Size   | Small/Medium  | Any size |
| Cost of Change | High          | Low |

---

## Conclusion 🎯
The Waterfall Model is a structured, phase-driven methodology best suited for projects with **fixed requirements** and **predictable outcomes**. However, for projects requiring **flexibility and iterative feedback**, Agile or hybrid models may be more effective.

### Agile Model
- Iterative and incremental.
- Focus on collaboration and customer feedback.
- Pros: Flexibility, faster delivery, better quality.
- Cons: Requires close collaboration, may lack documentation.

# Agile Methodology

## 📌 Introduction
Agile methodology is a project management and product development approach that emphasizes iterative progress, collaboration, and adaptability. Unlike traditional waterfall models, Agile promotes flexibility and continuous feedback.

---

## 🛠️ Key Principles of Agile

Agile is based on the **Agile Manifesto**, which prioritizes:
1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

### 🔄 Agile Values
- Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery
- Welcoming changing requirements at any stage
- Frequent delivery of working software
- Close collaboration between business stakeholders and developers
- Self-organizing teams
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
- Simplicity and efficiency in development

---

## 🏗️ Agile Frameworks
Several frameworks follow Agile principles. Here are the most common ones:

### 1️⃣ Scrum
Scrum is a lightweight framework with short development cycles known as **sprints**.
#### Key Components:
- **Scrum Team**: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team
- **Artifacts**: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment
- **Events**: Sprint Planning, Daily Standups, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective

### 2️⃣ Kanban
A visual workflow management system that focuses on continuous delivery.
#### Key Concepts:
- **Work in Progress (WIP) limits** to prevent overload
- **Pull system** where new tasks are started only when capacity allows
- **Kanban Board** for tracking progress

### 3️⃣ SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)
SAFe helps large enterprises implement Agile across multiple teams.
#### Key Features:
- Aligns business strategy with Agile execution
- Uses Agile Release Trains (ARTs) to synchronize work
- Supports Lean and DevOps principles

### 4️⃣ Extreme Programming (XP)
XP is focused on engineering practices to improve software quality.
#### Best Practices:
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Continuous Integration
- Pair Programming
- Refactoring
