# Day-1 : 🐳 Introduction to Containerization and Docker Basics ⚓


## Difference between Monolithic and Microservices

## Monolithic Architecture
- A single, unified application where all components are tightly coupled.
- Difficult to scale individual components.
- Deployment and updates require redeploying the entire application.
- Example: A traditional web application where frontend, backend, and database are all part of the same codebase.

## Microservices Architecture
- Application is broken down into smaller, independent services.
- Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
- Enables better fault isolation and easier technology upgrades.
- Example: An e-commerce platform with separate services for user authentication, product catalog, and order management.

# Difference between Traditional, Virtualization, and Containerization Deployment

| Deployment Type     | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Traditional**    | Directly installs applications on physical servers, leading to inefficient resource utilization. |
| **Virtualization** | Uses a hypervisor to create multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical server. Each VM has its own OS. |
| **Containerization** | Uses container technology to package applications and dependencies together, sharing the host OS for lightweight and efficient deployment. |

# Introduction to Docker Images and Its Naming

Docker images are lightweight, stand-alone, and executable software packages that include everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and dependencies.

## Naming Convention for Docker Images
A Docker image name follows this pattern:

```
<repository>/<image-name>:<tag>
```
### Example:
```
r123mahajan/new:latest
```
- **Repository**: Name of the repository (e.g., `nginx`, `ubuntu`)
- **Image Name**: A descriptive name for the image
- **Tag**: A label to identify different versions (e.g., `latest`, `v1.0`)

Example:
```
docker pull ubuntu:20.04
```

# Introduction to DockerHub and Amazon ECR

## DockerHub
Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service that allows users to store and distribute container images.

- **Public and Private Repositories**: Users can create both public and private repositories.
- **Pre-built Images**: Official images such as `nginx`, `mysql`, and `ubuntu` are available.
- **User Authentication**: Requires login for pushing images to private repositories.

## Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a managed container image registry service provided by AWS.

- **Integration with AWS Services**: Works seamlessly with ECS and EKS.
- **Access Control**: Uses AWS IAM for authentication.
- **Private Registry**: Secure storage of images within AWS.

# Docker Image Commands

## 1. Pull an Image
Downloads an image from DockerHub or any registry.
```
docker pull <image-name>:<tag>
```
Example:
```
docker pull nginx:latest
```

## 2. Login to DockerHub
Authenticates the user with DockerHub.
```
docker login -u <username>

* example docker login -u r123mahajan
```
For Amazon ECR:
```
aws ecr get-login-password --region <region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
```

## 3. Push an Image
Pushes an image to a remote repository (DockerHub or ECR).
```
docker push <repository>/<image-name>:<tag>

```
Example:
```
docker push myrepo/myapp:v1
```

## 4. Commit a Container as an Image
Creates a new image from a running container.
```
docker commit <container-id> <new-image-name>
```
Example:
```
docker commit abc123 my-custom-image:v1
```

## 5. Tag an Image
Tags an existing image with a new name or version.
```
docker tag <image-id> <repository>/<new-image-name>:<tag>
```
Example:
```
docker tag my-app:latest myrepo/my-app:v2
```

## 6. Remove an Image
Deletes an image from the local machine.
```
docker rmi <image-id>
```
Example:
```
docker rmi nginx:latest
```
###  Delete all Images
```
docker rmi -f $(docker images -aq)
```
# Understanding Docker Networking

## Introduction to Docker Network
Docker networking allows containers to communicate with each other, external services, and the host system. It provides flexibility in how containers interact with each other and the outside world.

## Different Network Drivers
Docker offers several network drivers, each suited for different use cases:

1. **Bridge Network (Default)**: 
   - Used when a container is started without specifying a network.
   - Containers can communicate with each other using container names.
   - Suitable for standalone applications.

   
2. **Host Network**: 
   - Removes network isolation between the container and the host.
   - The container shares the host's networking stack.
   - Best for performance-intensive applications where network isolation isn't needed.
   

3. **None Network**: 
   - The container has no network interfaces.
   - Useful for security-sensitive applications that do not require network access.
   

4. **Overlay Network**: 
   - Used in Docker Swarm mode for multi-host communication.
   - Connects containers across multiple Docker daemon instances.


   
5. **Macvlan Network**: 
   - Assigns a MAC address to a container, making it appear as a physical device.
   - Suitable for legacy applications requiring direct network access.
  
   
6. **IPvlan Network**: 
   - Similar to Macvlan but with more flexibility in IP management.
   - Offers better control over IP address assignment.

## Docker Network Commands
### Listing Networks
```sh
docker network ls
```
### Creating a Network
```sh
docker network create my_custom_network
```
### Inspecting a Network
```sh
docker network inspect my_custom_network
```
### Removing a Network
```sh
docker network rm my_custom_network
```
### Running a Container with a Custom Network
```sh
docker run -d --name my_container --network my_custom_network nginx
```
### Connecting an Existing Container to a Network
```sh
docker network connect my_custom_network my_container
```
### Disconnecting a Container from a Network
```sh
docker network disconnect my_custom_network my_container

```

2. **Run containers in the custom network:**
   ```bash
   sudo docker run --network my_custom_network --name container1 -d nginx

   sudo docker run --network my_custom_network --name container2 -d nginx

   docker network create --subnet "192.168.0.0/16" --driver bridge newnetwork
   
   docker run -d -P --network host nginx:latest
   ```
      # Day-5 : Docker Volumes

## Introduction to Docker Volume
Docker volumes are used for persisting data in Docker containers. Unlike bind mounts, volumes are managed by Docker and stored in a directory on the host machine that Docker manages (`/var/lib/docker/volumes/`). Volumes are the preferred way to handle data persistence in Docker because they are easier to manage and work across different environments.

### Why Use Docker Volumes?
- **Persistence:** Data remains even after the container is removed.
- **Ease of Management:** Docker manages volumes separately from containers.
- **Performance:** More efficient than bind mounts.
- **Backup & Restore:** Easier to move data between different environments.
- **Container Independence:** Volumes can be shared across multiple containers.

---
## Docker Volume Commands
### 1. Creating a Docker Volume
```sh
# Create a new volume
docker volume create my_volume
```
This creates a volume named `my_volume`.

### 2. Listing All Volumes
```sh
docker volume ls
```
This displays all the available Docker volumes.

### 3. Inspecting a Volume
```sh
docker volume inspect my_volume
```
This gives detailed information about the specified volume, including its mount path.

### 4. Removing a Volume
```sh
docker volume rm my_volume
```
This deletes the specified volume. (Ensure it is not being used by any container.)

### 5. Removing All Unused Volumes
```sh
docker volume prune
```
This removes all unused volumes to free up space.

---
## Using Docker Volumes with Containers
### 1. Creating a Volume and Attaching it to a Container
```sh
docker run -d --name my_container -v my_volume:/data nginx
```
This starts a container named `my_container`, mounts the `my_volume` to `/data` directory, and runs an `nginx` server.

### 2. Sharing a Volume Between Multiple Containers
```sh
docker run -d --name container1 -v shared_volume:/data nginx

docker run -d --name container2 --volumes-from container1 nginx
```
Both `container1` and `container2` share the same `shared_volume` for data persistence.

---
# Day-6 : Introduction to Dockerfile
A **Dockerfile** is a script that contains a set of instructions to automate the process of building Docker images. It allows developers to create customized container images with pre-installed applications and dependencies.

## Key Dockerfile Instructions

### 1. `FROM` (Base Image)
Specifies the base image for the container.
```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
```

### 2. `LABEL` (Metadata)
Adds metadata like author or description.
```dockerfile
LABEL maintainer="Your Name <your.email@example.com>"
```

### 3. `RUN` (Execute Commands)
Executes shell commands inside the container.
```dockerfile
RUN apt update && apt install -y nginx
```

### 4. `CMD` (Default Command)
Defines the default command to run inside the container.
```dockerfile
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

### 5. `ENTRYPOINT` (Command with Arguments)
Defines a fixed command with arguments.
```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["nginx"]
CMD ["-g", "daemon off;"]
```

### 6. `ENV` (Environment Variables)
Defines environment variables.
```dockerfile
ENV APP_ENV=production
```

### 7. `ARG` (Build Arguments)
Defines arguments used during the build process.
```dockerfile
ARG APP_VERSION=1.0
```

### 8. `COPY` (Copy Files)
Copies files from the local system to the container.
```dockerfile
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/
```

### 9. `ADD` (Copy and Extract Files)
Similar to `COPY` but supports extracting compressed files.
```dockerfile
ADD archive.tar.gz /app/
```

### 10. `EXPOSE` (Expose Ports)
Informs Docker that the container will listen on the specified port.
```dockerfile
EXPOSE 80
```

### 11. `USER` (Specify User)
Sets the user for running commands inside the container.
```dockerfile
USER nginx
```

### 12. `WORKDIR` (Set Working Directory)
Sets the working directory inside the container.
```dockerfile
WORKDIR /app
```

## Building and Running a Docker Image

### Build a Docker Image
```sh
docker build -t my-image .
```

### Push Image to Docker Hub
```sh
docker login
docker tag my-image username/my-image
docker push username/my-image
```

### Pull an Image
```sh
docker pull username/my-image
```

### Run a Container from the Image
```sh
docker run -d -p 80:80 my-image
```

# Brief Introduction to Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications using a simple YAML file. With Docker Compose, you can configure and launch your entire application stack, including services, networks, and volumes, in a single command.

## Key Features of Docker Compose:
1. **Single Configuration**: Define all services in a single `docker-compose.yml` file.
2. **Multi-Container Management**: Orchestrates multiple containers that form an application.
3. **Easy to Use**: Simple commands like `docker-compose up` and `docker-compose down` for deployment and teardown.
4. **Scalable**: Allows scaling individual services.

# Deploy a Three-Tier Application Using Docker Compose

In this example, we will deploy a **three-tier application** using Docker Compose. The three tiers include:
1. **Frontend**: Angular application (UI layer).
2. **Backend**: Spring Boot application (business logic layer).
3. **Database**: MySQL (data layer).

## Prerequisites:
- Install **Docker** and **Docker Compose** on your machine.
- Basic understanding of Docker and containers.

**Build and Start** the services using Docker Compose.
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
