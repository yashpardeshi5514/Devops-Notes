# Introduction to SCM (Source Code Management) Tool

## What is SCM?
SCM (Source Code Management) is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. It helps developers collaborate, maintain code versions, and ensure consistency across a project.

## Difference Between Centralized VCS and Distributed VCS

| Feature              | Centralized VCS (CVCS) | Distributed VCS (DVCS) |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Repository         | Single central repository | Multiple repositories (local + remote) |
| Example Tools     | SVN, Perforce        | Git, Mercurial      |
| Offline Work      | Not possible        | Possible (local commits) |
| Speed            | Slower (relies on central server) | Faster (local operations) |
| Collaboration     | Requires network access | Can work offline and push later |

# Introduction to Git
Git is a **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)** that enables efficient tracking of changes, branching, and collaboration among developers.

## Git Lifecycle
1. **Working Directory**: The local project files.
2. **Staging Area (Index)**: Files marked for the next commit.
3. **Local Repository**: Commits stored in the local `.git` folder.
4. **Remote Repository**: GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket where the code is shared.

```
Working Directory → Staging Area → Local Repository → Remote Repository
```

# Installing Git CLI
### Windows:
1. Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Install with default settings
3. Verify installation:
   ```sh
   git --version
   ```

### Linux:
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git -y
git --version
```

### Mac:
```sh
brew install git
git --version
```

# Git Commands (Working on Local Repo)

### Initialize a New Git Repository
```sh
git init
```
This command creates a new Git repository in the current directory.

### Check the Status of Files
```sh
git status
```
Shows modified and untracked files.

### Add Files to the Staging Area
```sh
git add <filename>
```
To add all files:
```sh
git add .
```
### commit and add 
```
git commit -a -m "update"

```



### Commit Changes
```sh
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
Commits the changes in the staging area with a message.

### View Commit History
```sh
git log
```
Displays the commit history.

### Revert Changes (Undo a Commit)
```sh
git revert <commit-hash>
```
This creates a new commit that undoes changes.

### Restore a File (Undo Local Changes)
```sh
git restore <filename>
```
Restores the file to the last committed state.

# Git Branching and Remote Repositories

## Git Branching

Branching in Git allows developers to work on different versions of a repository independently. Branches help manage features, fixes, and releases without affecting the main codebase.

### Common Types of Branches
1. **Main (Master) Branch** - The primary branch where production-ready code is maintained.
2. **Feature Branch** - Used to develop new features before merging into the main branch.
3. **Bugfix Branch** - Created to fix specific bugs without disrupting ongoing development.
4. **Release Branch** - Used for final testing before deploying a new version.
5. **Hotfix Branch** - Used to quickly patch critical issues in production.

### Git Branch Commands
- `git branch` → Lists all branches
- `git branch <branch_name>` → Creates a new branch
- `git checkout <branch_name>` → Switches to the specified branch
- `git checkout -b <branch_name>` → Creates and switches to a new branch
- `git branch -d <branch_name>` → Deletes a local branch
- `git merge <branch_name>` → Merges specified branch into the current branch
- `git diff <branch1> <branch2>` → Shows differences between two branches

---

## Introduction to Remote Repositories (GitHub)
A remote repository is a version of your project stored on an online platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. It allows collaboration, backup, and deployment of your code.

### Essential Remote Repository Commands
- `git init` → Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory
- `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` → Sets your Git username
- `git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"` → Sets your Git email
- `git remote add origin <repo_URL>` → Connects your local repository to a remote one
- `git clone <repo_URL>` → Clones a remote repository to your local machine
- `git pull origin <branch_name>` → Pulls the latest changes from the remote repository
- `git push origin <branch_name>` → Pushes local commits to the remote repository

### Workflow Example
```bash
# Create a new branch
$ git checkout -b feature-branch

# Work on changes
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Added new feature"

# Push the branch to GitHub
$ git push origin feature-branch

# Merge changes into the main branch
$ git checkout main
$ git merge feature-branch

# Delete the feature branch locally
$ git branch -d feature-branch
```

---

## Summary
- Git branches help manage different versions of a repository.
- Remote repositories enable collaboration and backup.
- Commands like `git pull`, `git push`, `git merge`, and `git checkout` are essential for workflow management.
- GitHub is a popular platform for hosting Git repositories.
